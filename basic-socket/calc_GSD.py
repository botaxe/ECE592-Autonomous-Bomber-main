    If your displacements aren't too great (less than a few kilometers) 
    and you're not right at the poles, use the quick and dirty estimate 
    that 111,111 meters (111.111 km) in the y direction is 1 degree (of
    latitude) and 111,111 * cos(latitude) meters in the x direction is 
    1 degree (of longitude).
